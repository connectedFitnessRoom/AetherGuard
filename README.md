# AetherGuard

Part of the code related to the mq135 sensor comes from https://github.com/GeorgK/MQ135/tree/master which is a **GNU General Public License v3.0** library. This library allows me to recover data from the mq135, I had to make a small modification to calibrate the auto sensor (I just passed a private variable to public)

Don't forget to install the other (for other components) libraries before launching the project ;)
